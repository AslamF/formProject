# Sign-Up Form

## Description

The motivation for this project was to implement what I have learned on forms, form styling, and form validation. The project has elements of HTML form, CSS psuedo classes, and javascript. It is not an intense project but more of an application of learning and applying what one has learned. There is flexbox and flex grid used for the styling, furthermore there is form validation to ensure one enters the correct information.
